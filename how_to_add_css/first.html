    <h1>Learning How to Add CSS to HTML Components</h1>

    <p>There are several ways to add CSS components to HTML:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>First: Adding styles to a single HTML component under the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag.</li>
        <li>Second: Adding styles directly to the HTML tag you want to style.</li>
        <li>Third: Adding CSS styles with a separate file from HTML.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <!-- Second -->
    <p style="color: blueviolet;">Which is more effective? All methods work well, but the most recommended is to separate the CSS file from the HTML file. This is useful for code efficiency and makes debugging styles easier.</p>
    <p>In this file, we will learn using the first and second methods, and then in a file named <code>second</code>, we will learn the third method.</p>
