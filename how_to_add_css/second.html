    <h1>Learning to Separate CSS from HTML</h1>
    
    <p>In this file, we will learn how to use the third method, which is separating the CSS file or code from the HTML code. This is highly recommended because it simplifies code writing, making it more concise and easier to debug styles.</p>

    <p>First, we add a <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tag below the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag, then add the <code>href</code> attribute that connects the HTML file to the CSS file. This attribute is filled with the location or directory of the CSS folder. Once connected, we can apply styles to the HTML elements we want to style.</p>
